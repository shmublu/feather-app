## KEY MARKET INSIGHTS
The global smartphone market size was valued at USD 457.18 billion in 2021 and is projected to grow from USD 484.81 billion in 2022 to USD 792.51 billion by 2029, exhibiting a CAGR of 7.3% during the forecast period. Based on our analysis, the global market had exhibited a decline of -7.8% in 2020 as compared to 2019. The global COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented and staggering, with smartphones experiencing lower-than-anticipated demand across all regions compared to pre-pandemic levels.

A smartphone is a mobile handset that empowers advanced access to internet-based facilities and other digital functions. Platforms including iOS, Android and others support a broad range of applications created by third-party originators. Factors such as governmental support to develop telecom infrastructure, budget-centric product launches, growing 5G technology, Artificial Intelligence and other technologies and increasing disposable income are contributing to the market growth.

Additionally, the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA) stated that the utilization of mobile phones specifically reduces travel for leisure and commuting. By 2025, it could result in a doubling of the avoided emissions leveraged by mobile technologies seen in 2018. As a result, it boosted the manufacturing need and usage amongst end-users. The GSMA also stated that there would be 75% smartphone adoption by 2022.

Moreover, leading companies such as Samsung, Apple Inc., Sony Group Corporation, Oppo and Vivo are constantly unveiling innovative products with 5G technology, which in turn is fueling market growth. For instance, in October 2021 Sony introduced the Xperia PRO-I combining advanced image processing and 4K 120p video recording to offer an innovative experience.

### COVID-19 IMPACT
Disrupted Demand and Supply Negatively Affected Shipments
In March 2020 the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. It disrupted demand and supply across the mobile phone sector and shipments declined due to nationwide lockdowns in China, India, the U.K., the U.S. and other major countries. The increasing cost was attributed to component shortages, higher logistics costs, currency devaluations and restrictions on travel and deliveries.

Nevertheless the work from home concept, adoption of 5G technology and other factors improved buying behavior over the long term. The International Data Corporation stated that smartphone shipments saw a 7.7% growth in 2021 compared to 2020.

### LATEST TRENDS
Ever-growing Demand for 5G-Compatible Smartphones
5G is a trending feature in mobile phones across the U.S., India, China, South Korea, the U.K., Japan and others. By 2025 the GSMA expects 20% of global connections to have 5G service with strong development across North America, Asia Pacific and Europe. The demand for virtual and augmented reality and low-cost, fast charging devices is brightening growth across developing and developed countries.

### DRIVING FACTORS
Increasing Adoption of Human-System Interaction to Bolster Growth
Mobile phone connectivity discovers applications in automobiles, fleet management operations, healthcare devices, smart metering, infrastructure security systems and more. Governments in India, China, Taiwan, the U.S. and others in partnership with leading companies are offering digital information and services that fuel demand. In April 2021 Apple committed to propelling 5G technology and silicon engineering by investing USD 430 billion in the U.S. over five years.

### RESTRAINING FACTORS
Shift in Trade Activities and Semiconductor Shortages
Changes in China-U.S. trade activities, the pandemic period and raw material shortages have hampered the market. Large organizations are suffering due to high production volumes while small and medium enterprises experience limited impact. Semiconductor shortages will affect the market until at least the end of 2022.
