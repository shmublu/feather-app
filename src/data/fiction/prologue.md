[1] In the heart of Rahka, under the perpetual twilight of its three suns, Da Solis, the Celestial Priest of the Solis Verio branch, received unsettling news.
[2] A courier, breathless and pale, delivered a scorched data-chip.
[3] It spoke of a lost shipment, not of common goods, but of sacred texts, vanished en route from the outer colonies.
[4] These weren't mere books; they were the lifeblood of their order, chronicles of the Galactic Wars and star-charts predating the Republic.

[5] Da Solis's chambers, an opulent office carved into the crystal heart of a mountain, grew silent save for the crackling of the bio-luminescent fireplace.
[6] He didn't rage.
[7] Instead, a grim smile touched his lips.
[8] This was not just a loss; it was a challenge.
[9] He would reclaim them.
[10] The Prologue to this new chapter of his life was being written, not in ink, but in resolve.
[11] He dismissed the courier, his gaze already distant, plotting a course through treacherous star systems, perhaps even to the rugged terrains of Garantuam if need be.
