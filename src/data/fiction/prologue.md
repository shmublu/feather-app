In the heart of Rahka, under the perpetual twilight of its three suns, Da Solis, the Celestial Priest of the Solis Verio branch, received unsettling news. A courier, breathless and pale, delivered a scorched data-chip. It spoke of a lost shipment, not of common goods, but of sacred texts, vanished en route from the outer colonies. These weren't mere books; they were the lifeblood of their order, chronicles of the Galactic Wars and star-charts predating the Republic.

Da Solis's chambers, an opulent office carved into the crystal heart of a mountain, grew silent save for the crackling of the bio-luminescent fireplace. He didn't rage. Instead, a grim smile touched his lips. This was not just a loss; it was a challenge. He would reclaim them. The Prologue to this new chapter of his life was being written, not in ink, but in resolve. He dismissed the courier, his gaze already distant, plotting a course through treacherous star systems, perhaps even to the rugged terrains of Garantuam if need be.
