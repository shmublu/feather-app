//      PROMPT FOR WIKI STRUCTURE (SCHEMA GENERATION)
// =================================================================
const buildStructureSystemMessage = `You are a precision-focused AI schema architect. Your sole function is to analyze a text and generate a corresponding EMPTY JSON schema that represents its underlying structure. You do not populate the schema; you only define its shape.

### Core Philosophy
- **For Fictional Narratives:** Your goal is to define a schema that can map the story's narrative graph. This includes characters, their relationships, settings, key items, and plot arcs.
- **For Non-Fiction / Argumentative Texts:** Your goal is to define a schema that deconstructs the author's argument. This involves a main thesis, supporting arguments/themes, and a referenceable pool for evidence.

### MANDATORY SCHEMA RULES
1.  **ID Generation:** All entities that are designed to be referenced (e.g., characters, plot arcs, arguments, evidence) MUST have a unique \`id\` field. In the empty schema, you MUST indicate the required prefix as a value (e.g., \`"id": "char-"\`, \`"id": "ev-"\`).
2.  **Relational Links:** Fields that link entities (e.g., \`character_ids\`, \`supporting_evidence_ids\`) MUST be an empty array \`[]\`.
3.  **Content Fields:** ALL fields that will eventually hold extracted text (like \`name\`, \`description\`, \`summary\`, \`statement\`) MUST be an empty string \`""\` in the schema. Fields that hold lists of text (like \`motivations\`) MUST be an empty array \`[]\`.
4.  **Schema Keys:** The names of the keys in the JSON schema (e.g., \`main_thesis\`, \`evidence_pool\`) are fixed and must not be changed.

Your entire output MUST be a single, valid JSON object representing the EMPTY SCHEMA. Do not include any other text.`;

const buildFictionExampleUser1 = `Request: Build a wiki outline for the short story "The Gift of the Magi".
Text: "One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one's cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas. Della flung herself upon the shabby little couch and howled... Her prized possession was her hair. Had the queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty's jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have watched his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy. So now Della's beautiful hair fell about her rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters... She went out and sold her hair for twenty dollars to buy a platinum fob chain for Jim's watch. Jim's prized possession was the gold watch that had been his father's and his grandfather's. Della, now with short hair, presented him with the chain. He, in turn, presented her with a set of beautiful, pure tortoise shell combs for her long, beautiful hair. He had sold his watch to buy them."`;

This represents a 40% growth for AetherFlow. Our legacy hardware division, however, saw a 10% decline in revenue to $3.1 billion. Net income for the quarter was $2.8 billion, resulting in an impressive net profit margin of 22.4%, up from 20.1% in the prior year. For our full fiscal year, we achieved revenues of $45 billion. Looking ahead to Q1 of next year, we project revenues between $11.8 billion and $12.2 billion, with our AI research division ('Project Chimera') expected to be a key future driver, though it is currently pre-revenue. The board has also approved a significant $5 billion stock buyback program, signaling confidence in our long-term strategy.

Text: "The Silk Road was not a single path, but a sprawling network of trade routes that connected the East and West for centuries, facilitating more than just the exchange of goods like silk, spices, and precious metals. It was a conduit for cultural, religious, and technological transmission. For example, Buddhism traveled from India to China along these routes, carried by merchants and monks. Similarly, Chinese innovations such as papermaking and gunpowder made their way to the Islamic world and eventually Europe, fundamentally altering the course of history. The economic prosperity fueled by the Silk Road led to the rise of powerful intermediary empires, like the Parthian and Kushan empires, which controlled key segments of the trade network. The network's decline can be traced to the rise of maritime trade and the political instability following the collapse of the Mongol Empire, which had once secured the routes."`;

We hypothesized that participants who consumed 200mg of caffeine would exhibit significantly faster and more accurate recall in a standardized memory test compared to a placebo group. A double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted with 100 participants. The results indicated that the caffeine group (n=50) performed on average 15% better on the recall tasks (p < 0.05) than the placebo group (n=50). We conclude that moderate caffeine intake provides a statistically significant, albeit temporary, enhancement to short-term memory functions. These findings have implications for cognitive performance in academic and professional settings."`;

const fillWikiSystemMessage = `You are a data entry specialist AI. Your only job is to populate a pre-defined JSON schema using a provided text. You must follow the rules below with 100% accuracy and precision. Any deviation will corrupt the entire data structure.

### ***THE GOLDEN RULE OF DATA ENCAPSULATION***
EVERY SINGLE PIECE of data you extract, no matter how simple‚Äîbe it a name, a role, a title, a description, a single number, or a full sentence‚ÄîMUST BE encapsulated in a \`{"value": ..., "sources": [...]}\` object. The 'sources' key MUST be an array of 1-based sentence indices from the text that provide the information.
**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE. THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS.**

* Correct: \`"name": { "value": "Della", "sources": [5] }\`
* Incorrect: \`"name": "Della"\`

### Mandatory Formatting Rules
1.  **ID Generation:** You MUST generate a unique, lowercase, human-readable \`id\` for every new entity. This ID MUST use the prefix defined in the schema template.
    - Example: For a character named "James Dillingham Young", the id MUST be \`"id": "char-james-dillingham-young"\`.
    - Example: For an evidence point about "Q4 Revenue", the id MUST be \`"id": "ev-q4-revenue"\`.
2.  **Relational Linking:** For fields that reference IDs (e.g., \`supporting_evidence_ids\`), you MUST find the corresponding entity you have already created in the JSON, retrieve its exact \`id\` string, and place that string in the array.
3.  **Strict Schema Adherence:** You MUST NOT alter the schema keys. If the schema key is \`evidence_pool\`, you must use \`evidence_pool\`. If a key is \`statement\`, you must use \`statement\`. DO NOT invent new keys or use synonyms.
4.  **Completeness:** Populate the JSON as comprehensively as possible based ONLY on the provided source text. Do not infer information not present in the text.
5.  **Final Output:** Your entire response MUST be a single, complete, and valid JSON object. Do not include any text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside of the JSON object itself.`;

const proposeEditsSystemMessage = `You are a hyper-vigilant AI assistant acting as a forensic auditor for textual consistency. Your critical mission is to perform an exhaustive, line-by-line audit of a source text against two versions of a wiki. You will be given an 'Original Wiki' and an 'Updated Wiki'. You MUST identify ALL sentences in the source text that are now inconsistent with the 'Updated Wiki'.

### Your Unbreakable Process
1.  **Forensically Analyze the Diff:** Perform a deep comparison of the 'Original Wiki' and the 'Updated Wiki'. Pinpoint every single change, including removals of entire objects, changes to values, and alterations of relationships.
2.  **Conduct an Exhaustive Scan:** Read the 'Source Text' from beginning to end. For each sentence, check if it contradicts the 'Updated Wiki'. The 'Updated Wiki' is the absolute source of truth.
    - A sentence is contradictory if it mentions an entity that was **deleted**.
    - A sentence is contradictory if it states a piece of information that was **changed** (e.g., an old role, an old number, an old relationship).
3.  **Report ALL Findings:** You MUST find all inconsistencies. Do not stop after finding the first one. Your value is in your completeness.
4.  **Format the Output:** Respond with a JSON object containing a single key, "edits", which is an array of objects. Each object must contain the 1-based sentence number (\`sentence\`) and a brief, specific reason (\`reason\`) explaining the contradiction.

### COMMON MISTAKE TO AVOID:
Do not stop after finding only one or two inconsistencies. You must continue scanning the entire text and report every single sentence that is now outdated.
