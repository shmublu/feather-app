In the grand city of Silvercrest, renowned for its towering spires and artisan guilds, a young cartographer named Elara dreamed of skies beyond the known world. Her mentor, Master Valerius, a stern but wise scholar of the Astrolabe Guild, often chided her for her fanciful notions. "The maps are complete, child. There is nothing beyond the Veiled Peaks," he would say, pointing to the jagged mountain range that bordered the kingdom of Eldoria. Elara possessed a unique artifact, a brass locket that was a gift from her late mother, Lyra. It was cold to the touch, always, and hummed with a faint energy.

One evening, a grizzled dragon-rider named Kael, his leather armor scarred from countless battles, landed his bronze dragon, Ignis, in the city's main plaza. He sought an audience with the Guild of Astrolabes, claiming to have flown over the Veiled Peaks. He spoke of a new land, a verdant continent he called 'Aerthos'. The Guild elders, including Valerius, dismissed him as a madman. But Kael presented a star-chart unlike any they had seen, with constellations that were impossible to view from Eldoria. The chart was etched on a scale from Ignis himself. Elara, seeing the chart, noticed its symbols matched markings inside her brass locket. She knew Kael was telling the truth. Together, they planned a journey to Aerthos, a quest that would defy the laws and maps of their world.
