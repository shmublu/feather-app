The development of the polio vaccine is a landmark achievement in medical history, culminating from the work of several key researchers. The story begins in the early 20th century, when polio was a terrifying epidemic. In 1935, two separate teams attempted to create a vaccine. Dr. Maurice Brodie, a researcher at New York University, created a formaldehyde-killed vaccine. Simultaneously, Dr. John Kolmer of Temple University developed a live-attenuated vaccine. Both projects ended in disaster, causing paralysis and death in some subjects, which halted vaccine research for years.

The breakthrough came in the late 1940s. A team at Boston Children's Hospital, led by Dr. John Enders, with Thomas Weller and Frederick Robbins, discovered in 1949 how to grow poliovirus in non-nervous tissue cultures. This pivotal discovery, which earned them the Nobel Prize in 1954, made it possible to produce large quantities of the virus for research. Building on this, Dr. Jonas Salk at the University of Pittsburgh developed a safe, inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). After a massive national trial in 1954, known as the Francis Field Trial, the vaccine was declared "safe and effective" on April 12, 1955. Later, Dr. Albert Sabin developed an oral polio vaccine (OPV), a live-attenuated vaccine that was easier to administer and became the standard for global eradication efforts.
